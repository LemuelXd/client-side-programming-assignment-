                    Web Hosting & Domain Name
                  Domain Name: To establish your online identity, register a unique domain name through providers like Namecheap, Google Domains, or GoDaddy. Choose a name that reflects your personal brand (e.g., yourname.com).
                   Web Hosting:For reliable hosting, consider platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for static sites. For more complex applications, services like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku provide robust solutions. I've deployed this portfolio on GitHub Pages for simplicity and reliability.
